# About This App

This is a simple online tip calculator built using React. It will prompt you to enter the total amount of the bill, the number of paying people in your party, and a tip amount. When you finish you will see a total bill amount including tip and an even breakdown for each member of your party.

## Live Application

To see this application in action, please visit the [site](https://online-tip-calculator.herokuapp.com/). You can even pull it up on your phone!

**NOTE:** This app is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and is on a free plan, so it will take some time for it to finish loading.

## Interacting With the App Locally

If you would like to use this application for your own projects or look under the hood, fork this repo and then clone it to your local machine.

### Running the App

To get things started, `cd` to the project directory and run `npm install` to make sure you have the required dependencies for the application to work. Once the setup is complete run `npm start`. The application will be ready to view on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If you make any changes to the code, the page will automatically reload once you save. If there are any errors, they will show up in the console.

# Other Useful Information

This app was built with `create-react-app`, and has included additional documentation you may find useful:

## Other Available Scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
